# Todo Demo App

Demo application using React-Native + Redux.

"Core" features not implemented:
1. Creating a list
2. Creating a todo item
3. Completing/un-completed a todo item

Opted not to do these because they just build on the core concepts of touch events, navigation, and API communication, and all of those concepts are already demonstrated.

## Running it

1. Clone [Todo Demo Server](https://github.com/anujbiyani/todo_demo_server)
    * set that up as per its Readme
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start:ios`
    * assumes you have the iOS simulator installed already
1. `npm run start:android`
    * not actually tested, emulator is broken on my machine and I haven't yet tried to sort that out
